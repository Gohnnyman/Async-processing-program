# Async-processing-program
A short async program, which calculates the size of Hilbert's Curve. 

<h2> How can I make Hilbert's Curve? </h2>
Program calculates only HTML files in "Async Prog/files" folder. There is Hilbert.exe there. You can run it (cmd mode):

`hilbert [steps] [direction] [file]`

`[steps]` - can be in interval from 0 to 12 (because of long time of runtime); <br>
`[direction]` - can be `-u`, `-d`, `-l`, `-r` (up, down, left and right); <br>
`[file]` - just a name of file as`file.html`

For example: `hilbert 8 -u file1.html`

<h2> How can I open program? </h2>
You need QT Framework for this. You can compile it in QT Creator or MVS with QT Framework extension.
